# ChatBot
# Project Description

A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate human conversation.It can be a valuable tool for automating tasks,
answering user queries, and providing a more interactive user experience.In this project, 
we will create a simple chatbot that can engage in text-based conversations.

# How the Chatbot Works

The chatbot is trained on a dataset of intents and responses stored in data/intents.json.
It uses NLTK and Keras for natural language understanding and response generation. The chatbot follows these steps during a conversation:

Tokenization and preprocessing: Input text is tokenized and preprocessed to prepare it for the model.

Intent recognition: The chatbot identifies the intent of the user's message.

Response generation: Based on the intent, the chatbot generates an appropriate response.

The conversation continues until the user decides to exit.
